# 4DN-Microscopy-Metadata-Tool
A interactive and intuitive tool for the collection and reporting of microscopy metadata

Adequate recordkeeping is essential for most experiments as it is necessary in order to evaluate results, share data and allow experiments to be repeated. Keeping notes on microscopy experiments should be relatively unchallenging in this regard, as the microscope is a machine equipped with a limited number of known parts and settings. Nevertheless, to this date no widely adopted set of metadata descriptors to be recorded or published with imaging data exists. Metadata automatically recorded by microscopes from different companies vary widely and pose a substantial challenge for microscope users to create a good faith record of their work. Similarly, the complexity and aim of experiments using microscopes varies leading to different reporting requirements from the simple description of a sample to the need to document the complexities of sub-diffraction resolution imaging in living cells and beyond.
Here we present a tiered system of guidelines for describing and documenting microscopy experiments developed by the 4DN Imaging Standards Working Group, a comprehensive list of metadata key-value pairs that should be recorded for each tier, a detailed explanation of why these values matter and an intuitive Graphical User Interface based tool to facilitate the recording of these metadata.
